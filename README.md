# Team Profile Generator


  ## Description
  
  My motivation to build this project was to practice an keep lerning how to use back end technologies just as  node, npm, jest for tests and also inquirer to create an app that builds an html document with a nice css design that allows any user that wants to create and add members to his or her work team, also i learned to use Object Oriented Programming to build this app
  
  The reason to build this project is because i know that having youe team well organized in your company is very important.
  
  The problem that this project solve is that managers of any company team have so many things on their head that sometimes i think that they can forget how important is to have a well organized team and to know with who they are working.
  
  The main lesson of this project was how to use inquirer in object oriented programming and also how to work with the same topic, how to use classes and tests to make the work cleaner and friendly readable.
